# Pipelined Microprocessor
The aim of this project was to design a basic microprocessor that implements pipelined architecture. 
We worked with Quartus Prime for this purpose, which was then implemented on an Altera Cyclone V FPGA. The individual components were written in the assembly language system verilog and they were connected using a schematic file in Quartus.
The microprocessor contains both data and instruction memory. Inputs are received through switches as binary number encoded instructions, and outputs are stored in memory as binary numbers and displayed through LEDs.
Please see the pdf for technical details of how the processor works.
